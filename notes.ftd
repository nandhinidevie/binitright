Gameplay Mechanics
1Ô∏è‚É£ Game Start
When the player starts the game, a 60-second timer begins.

The first waste item appears with bin options.

The player selects the correct bin to dispose of the waste item.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Correct Answer
The game moves to the next waste item instantly.

The number of cards left is displayed at the top (e.g., "5 items left").

If the player selects the wrong bin, a message appears:

‚ùå "Oops! That‚Äôs not the right bin. Try again!"

The timer pauses while this message is displayed.

The player clicks a "Try Again" button, and the same waste item reappears.

The timer resumes once the player is back in the game.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Running Out of Time
If the 60-second timer reaches 0, the player gets a message:

‚è≥ "Time‚Äôs up! Try again"

The game restarts from the beginning, and the timer resets to 60 seconds.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Completing All Cards Within 60 Seconds
If the player sorts all waste items correctly within 60 seconds, they see a final message:

üéâ "Awesome job! You sorted all the waste in 1 minute.

Bin it right Game for Hasiru Dala Innovations

UI: similar to [daily dump website](https://www.dailydump.org/pages/home-composters)


How It Works:
Player sees an image of a waste item (e.g., banana peel, plastic bottle, glass jar).

A "Choose Bin" button appears ‚Üí Clicking it opens a selection of bins (e.g., Wet Waste, Dry Waste, Recyclable, Hazardous).

A 5-second timer starts counting down ‚Üí The user must select the correct bin before time runs out.

Visual Feedback:
‚úÖ If correct: a message appears: ‚ÄúIt took you 5 seconds to segregate waste. It takes 500 years if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù Or a variation like ‚ÄúYou did it in 5 seconds! That‚Äôs 500 years less waste in landfills.‚Äù  or waste segregation takes five seconds, but if you don‚Äôt do it, it takes 500 years for that mistake to disappear.

‚ùå If wrong: A warning message pops up (e.g., "Oops! That doesn‚Äôt go there. Try again!").






Next Iteration: Series of Cards with a Landfill Visual

Instead of a single round, make it a series of 5-10 waste items the user must sort.
A landfill image on the side shrinks as the user correctly sorts the waste.
If they get one wrong, the landfill grows slightly to show the impact of poor waste management. OR if they get one wrong, the landfill doesn't shrink and a message pops, "Oops! That doesn‚Äôt go there. Try again!"

After all the rounds, the landfill is completely shrunk with a message like:
‚ÄúCongrats! You did a great job keeping our planet clean‚Äù
