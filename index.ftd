India generates 160,000 tonnes of waste every day. Only half (~ 80,000 tonnes per day) of
the collected waste is actually treated or processed (source: [CPCB](https://cpcb.nic.in/uploads/MSW/MSW_AnnualReport_2020-21.pdf)).
The rest either piles up in landfills or simply disappears from the
system, meaning it‚Äôs dumped illegally, burned, or lost in our streets,
rivers, and oceans.

The root cause is **lack of segregation at the source.**
In cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, a 
[large percentage](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/waste-sorting-at-home-a-weak-link-in-swachh-bharat-101728240822620.html)
of households still don‚Äôt segregate their waste.
Instead of composting or recycling, everything gets mixed into 
a mess that‚Äôs impossible to clean up.

Imagine if your street‚Äôs wet waste had been turned into compost, 
enriching soil, producing biogas, or creating liquid fertilizer.
Instead, it sits in a landfill mixed with plastic, e-waste, and
sanitary waste. It leaks toxic sludge, pollutes the air, and becomes
a daily nightmare for those who live nearby. Mostly because you didn‚Äôt
take a few seconds each day to sort it.

When we mix waste, we make the problem worse.

You‚Äôve probably heard, ‚ÄúFive seconds to put on your seatbelt,
five paramedics if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù That‚Äôs the thinking behind Bin It Right.
***Take five seconds to sort your waste, or let it pollute for 500 years.***

-- components.typo: How it works

Bin It Right is a simple game designed to train you to make better waste
segregation decisions. 

- You see an image of waste.
- You choose the right bin before time runs out.
- If you choose incorrectly or the time runs out, you can play again.

The game stores where a player left off and allow them to resume from the same point.

-- components.typo: Why gamify waste segregation?

Because learning through play makes habits stick. Gamification taps into our
natural instincts of challenge, reward, and repetition to make sorting
waste second nature. The timer in the game adds urgency, training you
to make quick decisions. 

-- components.rustic: 

If we can decide which post to like or which 
story to skip in seconds, we can sort our waste just as fast.

-- components.typo: Keeping it simple and easy

The game is intentionally designed to be simple and easy to play. 
The goal is to make waste segregation feel effortless, helping people
learn the habit quickly and integrate it into their daily routines.
By keeping it easy, we ensure that anyone (regardless of age) can play the game. 

Right now, Bin It Right is an MVP with only 13 common household waste items
classified into three bins:

üü¢Green (Wet Waste) - Food scraps.

üîµBlue (Dry Waste) - Plastic, paper, glass

‚ö´Black (E-Waste) - Batteries, electronics.

This basic segregation aligns with the ***minimum requirement*** across most
Indian cities. Properly segregating waste at this level makes it
easier for municipalities and private waste pickers to handle further
sorting, recycling, and disposal efficiently.

Note: India‚Äôs Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, emphasize waste
segregation into biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and hazardous waste.
However, color codes of bins vary by municipality.
